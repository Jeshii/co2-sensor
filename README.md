# co2-sensor
Code needed to run a CO2 sensor with an Arduino Uno and a Sensirion SCD41.

I didn't want to pay 41,000 yen to buy a CO2 monitor or pay 7000 yen only to find out it doesn't use a real CO2 sensor.

Here's my BOM:
- Sensilion CO2 Sensor Module SCD41 - https://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/product/B097P1FN4Z/
- Arduino Uno - https://amzn.asia/d/1yQqwCN

I'll be adding a screen and probably a battery at some point.
